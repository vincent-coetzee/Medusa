# Medusa
Medusa is a small but functional ODBMS for the Argon language. It currently has n o functionality as it is still at the start of development but in time it will include a 
compiler for Argon as well as logic for storing entire object graphs in the database. I have nver written a databadse before so I am learning as I go along. Still busy 
working with pages and more specifically BTree pages. One step at a time.
